Business Goal
We are building this project for taking orders from the customers on resurant counters. 

Platform
Linux (using docker), python, and deep learning libraries (pytorch or keras)

Success Criteria
We will be using WER (word error rate) to calulate the loss of the ASR model. 

Data
 - Training will be done on data of 2500 sentence. 
 - Each project member will record 25 sentences from a device, where each member will record from 2 devices. 

Testing
 - 5 mins (audio time) testing will be done to test the accuracy of the model in online mode (streaming). 

Future Scope
 - We will also be taking customer feedbacks and reviews from the same ASR system in the future. 
 - We will also try to expand the number of domains in the future. 
 - We will be using file input (mp3, wav) in the future.
